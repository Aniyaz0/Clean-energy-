From the start in 1945, one of the main priorities of the United Nations was to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.

As we all known, After the UN historic summit, agreed by the world leaders in September 2015, [17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030] officially came into force.


With the new 17Goals that universally apply to all countries, to end all forms of poverty, fight against inequalities, and tackle the climate change, while make sure that no one is left behind.

As Volunteers around the world we call for action by all countries, come to a plat form, poor, rich and middle-income to promote prosperity while protecting the planet, that end poverty must go hand in hand with strategies that build new economic growth and addresses a
range of social needs including education, health, social protection, and Job opportunities, while tackling the change and environmental protection.


Climate Change

The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned of the increasing dangers of climate change has of the urgency to find solutions before its too late.

At the present rate, greenhouse gas emissions are rising and the world is on a path to raise the global average temperature by more than three degree Celsius this century. The world is already experiencing the impacts of climate change, from sea-level rise to melting glaciers, to more extreme weather patterns.

The UNFCCC Secretariat Supported efforts to reach a new universal climate change agreement in Paris in 2015, providing path way forward to limit temperature rise to well below 2 degrees,


Climate Summit, held in New York in September 2014, helped raise awareness of the importance of climate change by mobilizing support for a climate agreement and catalysing action in advance of the Paris meeting in 2015.

In the outcome document, the commitment was reiterated to take further effective measures and actions, in conformity with international law, to remove the obstacles to the full realization of the right of self-determination of peoples living under colonial and foreign occupation, which continue to adversely affect their economic and social development as
well as their environment, are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person and must be combated and eliminated.


Maldives

Through 17SDGs2030, As Volunteers we like to initiate, and raise our voice at in the international communities to Support Us to create a new Job market through one big industry to tackle the Social issues.

Maldives is a tropical nation in the Indian Ocean composed of 26 coral atolls, which are made up of hundreds of islands. And Maldives is known for its white sandy beaches, blue lagoons and extensive reefs.

Maldives is referring to a small country nation, in nation that 99% of water, with most island less 0.5 Sqklm.

Major economy depends on “Fishing/Tourism, than we don’t have other resources to tackle such social issues.

As we focussed on “Maldives” regarding the Economic, Environmental and other Social Issues,

[7] Climate change also impacts island countries by causing natural disaster such as tropical cyclones, hurricanes, flash floods and drought.

Some law-lying island countries are slowly being submerged by the rising water levels of the Pacific Ocean.

And Island nation countries are more affected than other countries by climate change, which produces problems such as reduced land use, water scarcity and sometimes even resettlement issues.

The entire population of Maldives is spreads for, 190 islands, but most of the family’s moved their living to the city, because of less recourses.


Male' City the Capital of Maldives.

The capital of Maldives (Male’) would be around 5.3sqkm, its one of the highly crowded city when concerning to the size.

Nearly 153,000 natives lives in the capital, accept the same size of foreign workers that who nowadays working in the capital with out permit. The total population is more than 335,000 including foreign workers.

Most youths end’s their education in the Ordinary level and start their own life in very young age after ending his/her education. Yearly 7000 students end their education.

Living costs and other social issues have never been identifiable, house rents and other living basics are unreachable in the capital of Maldives, Male’. In the other hand foreign workers are overcrowded for the result of recklessness in this typical job market.

Good Education, finding Jobs and proper medications are the major challenging issues, that most of the family’s has to changed, their living to the city.


Most recent national logistics revealed by the government of Maldives in 21 October 2015.

Total Population of Maldives 400,000, and 40% of the population is Youths age 18–35 and unemployed.

Capital of the Country is overcrowded, and different Social and Economic issues are listed in the highest number in the world. Murdering the people and Selling drugs, theft, and money laundering, human trafficking issues not yet solved, and also living together in small apartments create other social issues.


Coral Reefs

When concerning about the Environmental Issues, the entire population of Maldives lives within 2 km of a coral reefs.

The total area of coral reefs in Maldives is 4,513 km2. And coral reefs are critical to human well-being.

If Coral reefs degraded, this could impact Tuna fisheries that contribute about USD 43 million per year to the GDP of Maldives.

With an annual global economic value of $375 billion, provided food for over 500 million people in 94 countries and territories, including Maldives where 181 kg of fish are consumed per capita per year.

At the same time Coral reefs buffer the shoreline from wave action and prevent erosion. And reefs protect highly productive wetlands, as well as ports, harbours and the economies they support.

It’s important to protect coral reefs; even the tourism contributes 27.9% of Maldives GDP. Approximately one million tourists visit Maldives for its white sandy beaches and to see the underwater beauty every year.

We can help, by reducing carbon emissions and Stop dredging or reclaiming the surfaces. Also by Spreading the word, coral bleaching, dispose of waste responsibility. Unsustainable and destructive fishing, and ocean acidification.


When focussing on the topic.

Huvadhoo Atoll is the largest coral island atoll. The Population of the area is nearly ¼. Mainly fishing is the only resources. Families started to move to the capital, for finding Jobs, proper medication, good education, etc.

But, we cannot tackle the Social issues without equivalent Job market for the population.

Though, we initiated as volunteers to tackle the Social, Environmental and Economic issues With the new 17Goals that universally apply to all countries, to end all forms of poverty, fight against inequalities, and tackle the climate change, while make sure that no one is left behind.

Personally we propose to RESDM Group to help to do the Research’s, regarding the issue, and how such an energy system Lead us to a better living in the future without crude oils .


Invest on Clean Energy

Renewable Energy and Sustainable Development Group / Maldives (RESDM) Group had been created with the intention to promote sustainable development of economy by means of optimal use of renewable energy resources.

Raise our voice in international community to Achieve SDG7#2030 and to reach WESP2017.

By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossilfuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology.

By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries and small island developing states.

#MAP – Electric Up to eighty five Islands including five habited Islands at Equatorial Channel Maldives 0◦. Through an offshore wind farm.

Through the Utilities we have seen the developed countries, areas, offshore wind farms offshore wind power refers to the construction of wind farms in large bodies of water to generate electricity.

Generating electric an Offshore Wind farm. Electric nearly up to 85 Villages (five habited islands including). Than we can get chances to use the rest of the uninhabited Islands to the other projects.

In 2012, 1,662 turbines at 55 offshore wind farms in 10 European countries produces 18 TWh, enough to power almost five million households. [45] As of August 2013 the London Array in the United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the World at 630 MW. This
followed by Gwynt Mor (576 MW)

These installations can utilize the more frequent and powerful winds that are available in these locations and have less aesthetic impact on the landscape than land based projects.

SGDs Action Campaign to Promote SDG2030, GOAL 7 (Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all) in South Maldives and achieve Economic, Social,
Environmental Sustainable development.

Though, We need assistance to make a Visual dimension to make Public awareness’s, that, through the Utility (electricity) what are the other opportunities we have in the future. And we ask National and International support to financial assistance to reach investors who had shown their interests investing on clean energy.

Currents are the motion in the ocean! While tides involve water moving up and down; currents are the back-and-forth movement of water. Two main components of currents are their speed and direction. A simple way to measure a current is to toss an object into the water and time how long it takes the object to travel a fixed distance. Technology allows us to be a little more accurate and sophisticated in our measurements. For example, the object in the water might be a buoy that is equipped with Global Positioning System technology and satellite communications to relay data and information about its change in position over time in the 


Natural resources

Natural resources are the basis of all wealth, and without access to many of them we simply die. None of us created this planet, yet a subset of us have claimed ownership of it.

If we are to achieve true justice, we must correct the inequality in rights to the use of the Earth. Not only must we be good stewards to the planet, and preserve it for future generations, but we must be fair to the existing generations as well.














By 2030, ensure access to affordable clean and modern energy for all.
